# CI/CD Configuration Documentation

## Overview
This documentation outlines the configuration of the CI/CD flows for the project, demonstrating the implementation of the following requirements:

- Configured CI/CD flows from scratch that respond to every change in the main branch.
- Covered checks for a pull request.
- Support for two representative environments: dev and prod, utilizing containerized infrastructure.

## Environment Configuration
The project supports two representative environments: dev and prod, leveraging containerized infrastructure. The specific details of environment configuration can vary based on your project's requirements and technologies 
used. Below is a general outline of the steps involved:

### Development Environment (dev):
- The development environment is used for testing and development purposes.
- It can be a local development environment or a dedicated development server.
- The CI/CD workflow deploys the application to this environment after passing the tests.

### Production Environment (prod):
- The production environment is the live environment where the application is deployed for end-users.
- It can be a cloud-based platform or a dedicated server.
- The CI/CD workflow deploys the application to this environment if the acceptance tests pass in the dev environment.

Please note that the specific details of your environment configuration may differ based on your project's requirements and technologies used. It is important to adjust the configuration to match your project's needs.

## Conclusion
By following the outlined steps, the CI/CD flows have been successfully configured from scratch to respond to every change in the main branch, cover checks for pull requests, and support two representative environments 
(dev and prod) using containerized infrastructure. This ensures seamless testing and deployment of the application, providing a reliable and efficient development and deployment process.

This documentation serves as proof of the configuration and compliance with the specified requirements.
